            Solar panels
        <p>Solar panels are those devices which are used to absorb the sun's rays and convert them into electricity or heat. Description: A solar panel is actually a collection of solar (or photovoltaic) cells, which can be used to generate electricity through photovoltaic effect.</p>

            Charge controllers
            <p>A solar charger collects energy from your solar panels and stores it in your batteries. With the latest and fastest technology, SmartSolar maximizes this energy harvest through intelligent control, so that a full charge is realized in the shortest possible time. SmartSolar keeps the battery in good condition and thus extends its lifespan.</p>

         DC power
         <p>DC power connectors are designed to supply direct current from a mains connection to a device and is typically used to power small to medium appliances. Although there are various types of DC Connector, the most common type is sometimes referred to as a Barrel Connector.</p>

        Inverter
        <p>An inverter is an electronic device that can convert the input voltage from one voltage to another voltage or convert electrical energy into energy of a different frequency. Unlike a transformer, an inverter can convert a DC voltage to an AC voltage, or an AC voltage to an AC voltage with a different frequency. Depending on the application, we speak of a voltage converter, a frequency converter, or a combination of both.</p>

        AC power
        <p>Instantaneous power in an electric circuit is the rate of flow of energy past a given point of the circuit. In alternating current circuits, energy storage elements such as inductors and capacitors may result in periodic reversals of the direction of energy flow.</p>
